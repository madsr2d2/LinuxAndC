<p>When the StackAllocation function is called we get the following output.</p>
<pre><code>***************
StackAllocation
***************
Value of x = 7
Address of x = 0x7ffc7811b05c
Value of y = 7
Address of y = 0x7ffc7811b05c</code></pre>
<p>When foo1 is called, the variable x gets declared, meaning that x is allocated the address at the top of the stack. Then, x gets initialized to 7, meaning that 7 gets stored at the address allocated to x. When foo1 exits, the address assigned to x is freed up. Subsequently, when foo2 is called the address, which was formerly allocated to x, is now allocated to y. However, y is not initialized to anything, so the address still stores the value assigned to x in foo1. Accordingly, the addresses and values of x and y are identical.</p>
